Deaf-mute is a term which was used historically to identify a person who was either deaf using a sign language or both deaf and could not speak. The term continues to be used to refer to deaf people who cannot speak an oral language or have some degree of speaking ability, but choose not to speak because of the negative or unwanted attention atypical voices sometimes attract. Such people communicate using sign language. Some consider it to be a derogatory term if used outside its historical context; the preferred term today is simply "deaf".</p>

                    <h3>Historical Usage of the Term "Deaf-Mute"</h3>
                           <p>It is sometimes used to refer to other hearing people in jest, to chide, or to invoke an image of someone who refuses to employ common sense or who is unreliable. "Deaf and dumb","semi-deaf" and "semi-mute" are other historic references to deaf people.

In the past deaf-mute was used to describe deaf people who used sign language, but in modern times, the term is frequently viewed as offensive and inaccurate. From antiquity (as noted in the Code of Hammurabi) until recent times, the terms "deaf-mute" and "deaf and dumb" were sometimes considered analogous to "stupid" by some hearing people.

The simple identity of "deaf" has been embraced by the community of signing deaf people since the foundations of public deaf education in the 18th century and remains the preferred term of reference or identity for many years. Within the deaf community there are some who prefer the term "Deaf" (upper-case D) to "deaf" (lower-case) as a description of their status and identity.

Classification as a deaf-mute has a particular importance in Jewish law. Because historically it was thought impossible to teach or communicate with them, deaf-mutes were not moral agents, and therefore were unable to own real estate, act as witnesses, or be punished for any crime. However, today when techniques for educating deaf people are known, they are no longer classed as such.</p>

                    <h3>The Name Game</h3>
                    <p>Recent news has brought our attention to our language and terms we use to describe each other. Countless labels involving race or gender are widely known and deemed to be distasteful, insulting,   or just politically incorrect.Many in the Deaf community have fought tirelessly over the years to change the terminology used to describe individuals with varying levels of hearing.As a kid, I remember hearing “Deaf and Dumb“. I knew that “dumb” referred to an inability to speak, but the other meaning of the word crept into my awareness causing me to see deaf people as mentally diminished in some way.  Watching my deaf sister’s accomplishments as a child, I was amazed at how much she could do considering her “diminished” mental state. I was a kid and didn’t know any better, but I know I wasn’t the only one with this misconception.</p>
